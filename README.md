## 🎤 Introduction

Welcome to Laurine's (a.k.a Luu) first java program. It's a card game where you compete against the computer


The final project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/xLuuxx/cards-java.git)

## 📜 Rules

The rules are simple : 
- The ACE is stronger than the KING.
- You and the computer each play a card; the stronger card wins.
- Each win earns one point, and the first to reach 7 points wins.
- In case of a tie, both players receive a point.
